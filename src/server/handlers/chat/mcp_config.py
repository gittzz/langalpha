"""Per-workspace MCP configuration resolution — the single chokepoint.

Modeled on ``resolve_llm_config``. Merges the process-global built-in MCP
servers (from ``base_config.mcp.servers``) with a workspace's DB-backed rows
into one deterministic effective set:

    effective = built-ins (config order)
                MINUS names disabled by a (source='builtin', enabled=false) row
                PLUS  source='workspace' enabled rows (alphabetical, appended)

The merged list and the DB↔model converter are defined ONCE here so the API
effective-list endpoint and the sandbox-sync path can import the same logic
(no prompt/wrapper divergence).
