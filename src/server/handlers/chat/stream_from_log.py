"""Redis-Streams-backed SSE consumer.

One XREAD BLOCK loop serves every consumer type (first-connect, reconnect,
second tab, subagent SSE, late subscriber). The workflow is a fire-and-forget
producer writing to ``workflow:stream:{thread_id}`` and
``subagent:stream:{thread_id}:{task_id}``; consumers attach by stream key and
read by cursor with no in-process state shared with the workflow.

Both streams store pre-rendered SSE wire strings. The subagent consumer also
handles legacy JSON records (``{seq, event, data, agent_id}``) that age out
after their TTL window.
