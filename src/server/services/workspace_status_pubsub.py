"""Cross-worker pub/sub for workspace lifecycle status changes.

Replaces the loser-side DB poll loop with a push notification so a
stopped→running transition wakes waiting workers in milliseconds rather
than 0.5–2 s polling cycles. Also feeds the ``/workspaces/{id}/events``
SSE channel so the frontend can drop interval-polling.

Degrades silently when Redis is unavailable: ``subscribe_to_status``
yields ``None`` and ``publish_status_change`` is a no-op, so callers
must keep their DB-poll path as a safety net.
