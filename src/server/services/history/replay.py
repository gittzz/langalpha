"""Assemble checkpoint-sourced replay items for the replay endpoint.

Produces the same ``{"event": type, "data": dict}`` items as the stored
``sse_events`` path, sourcing the transcript from checkpoints (via
``CheckpointHistoryReader`` + the pure projector) and merging the
non-derivable remainder from persisted events:

- ``steering_delivered`` and ``context_window`` (token_usage, summarize,
  offload) are projected from checkpoint state — steering payloads and
  summarize fields are stamped into message ``additional_kwargs`` at emit
  time, token usage comes from ``usage_metadata``, offload counts and the
  summarize event from private-state deltas. While the sse dual-write is on,
  a turn with stored events replays those verbatim instead (richer historical
  payloads, exact mid-turn positions).
- ``provenance`` / ``credit_usage`` are table-sourced (provenance_records /
  conversation_usages rows, written at persist time); answered ``interrupt``
  cards project from the resume boundary's ``__interrupt__`` pending writes;
  the terminal ``error`` event reconstructs from the response row (both replay
  paths — it is yielded live *after* the persist snapshot, so stored events
  never contain it). While the sse dual-write is on, a turn with stored events
  replays the stored copies instead.
- ``html_widget`` artifacts prefer the stored event when present — the live
  event inlines resolved data files that are deliberately kept out of the
  checkpointer.
- Sandbox image paths in projected text resolve through ``image_capture``
  ui records; a turn whose images cannot be resolved falls back to its stored
  events wholesale (turn-level granularity keeps ordering coherent).
