"""Per-turn replay projection cache.

Wire-ready replay items for one settled turn, keyed by the turn's own last
checkpoint id (its *tail*). The tail exists at persist time and survives
forks of later turns (edits/regenerates fork new tails → new keys; orphaned
entries expire by TTL), so entries are immutable — except the interrupted-turn
refresh: a turn's ``ending_interrupts`` ride the resume boundary created
later, so the post-persist refresh rebuilds a two-turn window to overwrite
the previous turn's entry under its unchanged key.

Entries are canonicalized to the wire's JSON form (``default=str``) before
storing so a cache hit is byte-identical to a fresh projection. Purely an
optimization: any miss falls back to a full checkpoint rebuild + backfill.
