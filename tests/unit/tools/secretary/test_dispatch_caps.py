"""Coverage for the report-back dispatch caps (per-flash + per-user).

A flash thread can fan out many background PTC analyses, but unbounded fan-out
would overload the single backend. ``report_back._reserve_slot_membership``
atomically admits a dispatch under both caps *before* the dispatch POST (rolled
back on failure), so racing calls can't both pass the check then overshoot.
