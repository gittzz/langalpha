"""Regression tests for web_fetch's extraction LLM handling.

Two bugs collapse into one fix at ``src/tools/fetch.py::_extract_with_llm``:

1. The shared ``subsidiary_llm_clients["fetch"]`` override was mutated in
   place when streaming was flipped to False — poisoning every subsequent
   caller that reused the instance.
2. Codex-OAuth models (``ChatCodexOpenAI``) require ``stream=true`` at the
   proxy layer; the old unconditional flip returned HTTP 400
   ``Stream must be set to true``.

These tests pin both behaviors.
